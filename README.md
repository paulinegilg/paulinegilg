## Hi there 👋

I'm a front-end Developer currently working at the University of Strasbourg on cool projects for students 🎓 and staff 👨‍🏫. 
Passionate about cycling 🚴‍♀️ in the mountains ⛰️, spending time outdoors 🌳, and building things 🛠️ in a low tech way.

In my free time, [I teach](https://caradoc.paulinegilg.fr/fr/) CAWEB Master's students about web quality, privacy, and accessibility 📚.

Currently learning UX theory, CI stuff, and Docker 👩‍💻.

You can reach me ✉️ via [my personal website](https://paulinegilg.fr)!
